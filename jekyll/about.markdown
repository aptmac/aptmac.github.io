Hey, you found me. I'm not sure how or why you did, but you did.

Off the top of my head, maybe you're here because:

* you're interested in JDK Mission Control
* we just played (or are scheduled to play) a set of games in Tekken 8, SF6, 2XKO, or whatever fighting game is neat these days

Regardless, I'm aptmac, and among many things I am a Software Developer, fighting game enthusiast, and amateur musician
