It has been a while since the [last time](https://aptmac.github.io/jmc/2021/09/14/copr-jmc.html) I prepared JDK Mission Control for Fedora using COPR. 

I'm back here to let everyone know that I've updated my repos, and will try to have JMC available through Fedora for the foreseeable future.

I'm going to try and keep two repositories: one for the [latest stable release](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/almac/jmc/) (9.1.1 currently), and one for the [latest SNAPSHOT build](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/almac/jmc-snapshot/) (10.0.0-SNAPSHOT currently).

Both of these repositories are simple wrappers around the Adoptium builds of JMC, so if you're curious about the actual builds or where to find the binaries, please check out: [https://github.com/adoptium/jmc-build](https://github.com/adoptium/jmc-build)

If you're interested in the files that I use to setup COPR releases, please check out my repo at [https://github.com/aptmac/adoptium-jmc-copr](https://github.com/aptmac/adoptium-jmc-copr)

You can enable the COPR repo and install them directly onto your Fedora machine using the following commands:

**9.1.1**

{% highlight bash %}
// enable the copr repo
$ dnf copr enable almac/jmc

// install jmc
$ sudo dnf install jmc

// run jmc
$ jmc
{% endhighlight %}

**10.0.0-SNAPSHOT**
{% highlight bash %}
// enable the copr repo
$ dnf copr enable almac/jmc-snapshot

// install jmc
$ sudo dnf install jmc

// run jmc
$ jmc
{% endhighlight %}
